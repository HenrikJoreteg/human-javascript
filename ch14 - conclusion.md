# A few closing thoughts

## 1. We're not done

This book will continue to evolve along with the corresponding tools and techniques. We plan to continue publishing updates to keep the contents current. That's one of the great things about ebooks. We've even built a continuous integration system for the book. Any time we push an update to the master branch for the book repository, our CI server generates new ebooks.

## 2. Staying up to date

Follow @HenrikJoreteg and @andyet on twitter to hear about updates and changes. We'll be turning the site: http://humanjavascript.com into a jumping off point for finding related tools and resources.

## 3. Open source is a group effort

We're under no illusions that the approaches in here are perfect. All of the tools are open source and hosted on github. If you would like to contribute, please get involved.

## 4. Feedback on the book

If there was anything that was unclear, incorrect, missing, or could be improved on the book itself. We want to hear from you. You can email me directly: henrik@andyet.net with any feedback.

## 5. Thank you, thank you, thank you

At &yet we believe in the open web and invest heavily in building applications and tools that improve the web we love. Your support, through buying the book, helps fund our open source efforts. I hope this has given you some tools and confidence to go forth and build awesomer stuff. I would argue that the web has greater potential for good than any other human invention throughout history. We're a privlidged few, who are fortunate enough to have been born at the right time with the right skills to get to participate in building the web. Our time is short. One of my favorite quotes comes from a poet, Hafiz, that Adam Brault introduced me to:

> What will you do with your one wild and precious life?

Please consider using your talents to build things that improve the lives of humans in signifiant ways. <3
